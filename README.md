# Risk-Assessment-and-Report-Writing

In this project, we simulate the structured planning and documentation for an external penetration test engagement, focused on risk identification, threat assessment, and professional cybersecurity reporting.

üü° **Inception State:** No prior testing engagement exists, and no baseline risk documentation is available.  
üü¢ **Completion State:** Risk assessment walkthrough is completed across five well-defined phases, with technical and executive reporting deliverables prepared for client review.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

We begin with passive information gathering to understand the organization‚Äôs public-facing digital footprint.

### Activities:
- Employed OSINT techniques using tools like Shodan, WHOIS, Google Dorking, and theHarvester.
- Identified external IP ranges, domains, email formats, and exposed services.
- Organized findings in structured documentation for team reference.

- [Reconnaissance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VgrH-IhTWGMuiGNR_aNRhQFSlbOp_U41HCxfHRppZ0/edit?usp=sharing)
---

## Phase 2: Target Identification & Scanning

We simulate the scanning process by planning and documenting how port scanning and service discovery would be executed.

### Simulated Activities:
- Planned Nmap scanning for open ports and service versions.
- Scheduled vulnerability scanning using tools like NMap, OpenVAS (simulated).
- Mapped discovered services to potential attack vectors.

---

## Phase 3: Vulnerability Identification

Using mock scan outputs and service discovery notes, we performed vulnerability identification.

### Activities:
- Matched discovered services with known CVEs.
- Researched CVE impact using NIST and Mitre databases.
- Documented findings with risk descriptions and affected versions.

---

## Phase 4: Threat Assessment

We ranked the identified vulnerabilities based on **likelihood** and **impact**, incorporating business sensitivity and criticality.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Likelihood:** Exploitability, exposure, known exploits.
- **Impact:** Data sensitivity, business continuity, regulatory implications.
